## Dataset

> This involves the analysis of WeRateDogs. This data was presented from udacity for students to work on as our second project. The data sets are in three files.The first one is the twitter_archive which includes more than 5000+ retweets. The second one was gotten by using neural network to predict if the images present are dogs and with what probability. The third data was gotten by  querying the twitter retweet count and favorite count using the twitter id present.
